## Utils
<details>
<summary>
<code>/users/get_csrf_token</code>
</summary>
<br>
This function is used to retrieve the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token for the current session and return it in a JSON response. A CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token is a security measure used to protect web applications from CSRF attacks. It is a secret, user-specific token that is included in all form submissions and side-effect URLs to prevent unauthorized actions from being performed on behalf of the user. The token is generated by the server and sent to the client, typically embedded within the HTML form as a hidden field. 

### Entrypoint

`GET /users/get_csrf_token`

### Parameters
- `request`: The HTTP request object.

### Returns
The CSRF token is returned in a JSON response with the key "csrfToken" and a `200 OK` HTTP status code.

### Notes

- The `@require_http_methods(["GET"])` decorator ensures that the view only accepts HTTP GET requests. Other request methods will result in a "Method Not Allowed" response.
- The `@ensure_csrf_cookie decorator` ensures that a CSRF cookie is included in the response.
- Inside the function, `get_token(request)` is a function that retrieves or generates a CSRF token.


- In any template that uses a POST form, use the csrf_token tag inside the `<form>` element if the form is for an internal URL, e.g.:

`<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}`

- **WARNING : This should not be done for POST forms that target external URLs, since that would cause the CSRF token to be leaked, leading to a vulnerability.**
